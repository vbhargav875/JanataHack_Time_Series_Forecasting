This repository contains my solution to the JanataHack - Time Series Forecasting Hackathon conducted by Analytics Vidhya.

The aim of the hackathon is to train a model on the given train data and predict the 'electricity_consumtion' for the test data.

I have tried the following models in my Code after performing basic featuring engineering:

1) Light GBM
2) Random Forest
3) XGBoost
4) Convolutional Neural Network
